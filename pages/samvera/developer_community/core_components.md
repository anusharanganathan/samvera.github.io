# Samvera Code Repository

The [primary Samvera code repository](https://github.com/samvera) contains the 
Samvera community's current consensus 
on what we are using, maintaining, and recommending. Ideally, this repository 
only contains code modules that are being actively used and maintained. Anything 
that falls into disuse should be a candidate for [deprecation](deprecation.html). 

## Maintenance

The Core Components Working Group is in the process of creating a framework for 
addressing ongoing maintenance of shared code repositories.
