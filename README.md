# How Does This Work?

We use a Jekyll-based custom theme for markup and display, and pages are published to http://samvera.github.io.

## Adding or Editing Content

These are community documents, so we rely on the pull request model. If you'd like to contribute content:

- clone the project
- make a branch  
- create/edit pages within the Hydra directory
- add their links to home_sidebar.yml
- tag them appropriately


## Our Theme

We use a Jekyll theme designed for [documentation](https://github.com/tomjohnson1492/documentation-theme-jekyll). We chose the Documentation Theme because of its excellent navigation and clear page layout, and for the ease of working in markdown.
